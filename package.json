    "changelog": "### Added\n\n* Added extra 'remove' marker in the list. \"Render Wait\" entry removes the Gfx.WaitForRenderThread\n* Fixed self times for the last few markers in the list (when the depth did not return to 1).\n\n### Changed\n\n* Performance optimization to the loading and analysis phases, saving time to open and analyse. Also reduces memory usage.\n* Added more functional tests\n* Removed support for the old .padata format which was rarely used. To load these files you must load them into the older 1.2.4 version to resave as .pdata format to be able to use going forward.\n* Updated frame histogram and box and whisker to be min based rather than zero based to match the marker view"
